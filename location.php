<p>Bitola historically known as Monastir or Manastır is known also by several alternative names is a city in the southwestern part of the Republic of Macedonia. The city is an administrative, cultural, industrial, commercial, and educational centre. It is located in the southern part of the Pelagonia valley, surrounded by the Baba and Nidže mountains,14 km north of the Medžitlija-Níki border crossing with Greece. It is an important junction connecting the south of the Adriatic Sea with the Aegean Sea and Central Europe. It has been known since the Ottoman period as "the city of the consuls", since many European countries have consulates in Bitola. According to the 2002 census, Bitola is the second largest city in the country.Bitola is also the seat of the Bitola Municipality. Bitola is one of the oldest cities on the territory in the Republic of Macedonia. It was founded as Heraclea Lyncestis in the middle of the 4th century BC by Philip II of Macedon. During the Ottoman rule the city together with Salonica were the two reigning cities of Ottoman Rumelia.</p><hr />

<h3>Attractions in Bitola</h3>
<p style="color:#2bc0a4; font-weight:600;">1. Sirok Sokak (Broad street)</p>
<p>Bitola, the second largest city in Macedonia, is a new tourism destination in southeastern Europe with a unique offer for the admirers of antique, old architecture, beautiful mountain landscapes, as well as cultural artistic manifestations organized during the whole year.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:1%;">The famous street Sirok Sokak stretches through the square. There are a large number of café-bars and restaurants, shops, theater and cinema, galleries and consulates. Bitola has a special architectural ambient specific for it since the second half of the 19th century when Austria, Russia, England, France, Greece, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Italy opened consulates. Since then Bitola is renowned as the city of Consuls, pianos and chariots. The end of Sirok Sokak leads to a wide flowery park full of tree lines followed by a zoo and the archaeological site Heraclea Lyncestis</p><br /><hr />


<p style="color:#2bc0a4; font-weight:600">2. Churches and mosques</p>
<p>The most conspicuous monument in Bitola is the 33 meter high Clock Tower erected in 1830, whereas 60.000 eggs were put in the plaster, in order to give the building more strength. The past centuries only justify that building mastery.</p>
<p>Next to the Clock Tower is the statue of Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander The Great and founder of the predate city of Bitola, the antique city Heraclea.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of churches and monasteries, Bitola in its history bared the name Monastir. Now the square is adorned by the church Saint Dimitry from 1830, famous for its gilded carved iconoclasts. There are many mosques too. Among them Isac Mosque with the highest cube in the Balkans. The churches and mosques actually transcend the century long picture of Bitola – city of cosmopolitanism and coexistence.
Bitola is also known by the reformer of modern Turkey Mustafa Kemal Atatürkwho was educated here. In his honor a museum set-up is posed. Given this historical connection, the Turks are the most common visitors in Bitola.</p>

<p style="color:#2bc0a4; font-weight:600">7. The Jewish Cemetery of Bitola/Monastir </p>
<p>The Jewish Cemetery of Bitola/Monastir ‘BEIT HAIM’ (Home of the Living) was founded in 1497, only five years after their expulsion from Spain.  This is one of the oldest, if not the oldest Jewish Cemetery on the Balkans. It has served the Jewish community of Monastir for more than 400 years.</p>
<p>During World War I, when the front line was passing through the town, Jewish cemeteries suffered severe damage from the bombing of the city conducted by the Central Powers (Germany and Bulgaria) throughout 1916.</p>
<p>In 1961, the City Council of Bitola decided to remodel the entire complex and to create a park that would carry the memories of the former Jewish community and to put this memorial park under government protection. The project was developed and initial calculations were made, parts of the funds for spatial reconstruction were assigned, but nothing was undertaken.</p>
<div style="float:right;"><img class="lokacija_mobilen_evrejski" src="img/Location/8evrejski.jpg" style="border-radius:7px; margin-left:4%;"/><p style="font-size:small; font-style:italic; text-align:center;">The Jewish Cemetery of Bitola</p></div>
<p>A civil campaign to restore the cemetery and create a Holocaust memorial complex there began in 1997 to coincide with the 500th anniversary of its foundation. Considerable work was carried out, including the restoration of the monumental entrance gate, declared a national historic-cultural monument. It has a central Gothic arch flanked by two Gothic-arched windows and features a facade whose upper part is decoratively ribbed. This initiative lost its momentum in 2005 when work began on the construction of the Memorial Center in Skopje, but it regained when the Memorandum for cooperation between Israel and Bitola/Monastir was signed. It envisages the creation of a memorial park to honor the Jewish population that lived here and further nurture the good relationship between Israel and Macedonia. ARHAM  had an essential role in the signing of the agreement. Today, the Cemetery is fully enclosed by a wall (three sides are masonry and part of the front is decorative iron grille work). The main gate stands at the bottom of the hill. Several thousand grave markers remain, but most are illegible and only a few – in the lower left corner as seen from the entrance – are in good condition. Most of the gravestones lie flat, in the Sephardic manner.

<p style=" margin-bottom:10%;">With spacious pine tree forests, glacial lakes and alpine meadows, the National park Pelister, 15 km from Bitola, is a place for rest and adventure. With 2601 meters, Pelister is the highest summit of Baba Mountain. The glacial Big and Small Lakes, also known as “Mountain Eyes” radiate with special beauty. The mountain is a dwelling of rare animals, birds and plants. In the lakes live indigenous crabs, while in the streams there is the rare Pelagonia trout. The main phenomena of the park is the five needle pine “Molika”, a relict of the Tertiary and endemic Balkan tree, indigenous kind that grows only on several mountains on the Balkans.</p><hr />
